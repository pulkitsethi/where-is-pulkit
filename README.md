# Where Is Pulkit
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pulkitsethi/where-is-pulkit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pulkitsethi/where-is-pulkit)

*Where Is Pulkit* started as a personal project to allow family and friends to track my progress on a road trip I took across the country. What it turned into was a way to journal my trip by not only tracking the path I took, but mashing it up with the social services I use to show pictures, checkins, and tweets. My goal is to create an app in which anyone can host their own *Where Is <INSERT_NAME>* and journal and share their own journeys. But hopefully do it in a way that is natural to how they share their lives online by making it automatic and unobtrusive.
